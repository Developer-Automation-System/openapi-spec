    Welcome to ZoomInfo's API. ZoomInfo is the leading data intelligence
    platform for B2B go-to-market teams, presenting a trifecta of the broadest,
    deepest and highest quality B2B data.


    Use the API to query the ZoomInfo database for relevant companies and
    contacts and enrich the data records in your Customer Relationship
    Management (CRM), Marketing Automation (MA), and other systems in your
    organization. The API helps you build out your organization's contact and
    company records by tapping in-depth information such as technologies used,
    company attributes, corporate hierarchies, funding details, news alerts and
    scoops, and more. This deep data enables teams to build sophisticated,
    refined, and targeted prospect segments, as well as improve campaign list
    building, prospecting, lead routing, scoring, and territory alignment.


    # API structure


    The ZoomInfo API is a set of HTTPS endpoints you can use to programmatically
    retrieve and integrate ZoomInfo data into your existing technology stack and
    workflows. Responses are returned in JSON to support integration with common
    programming languages and development kits.


    The Enterprise API supports searching for and enriching company and contact
    records, and are comprised as follows:


    **Standard APIs**


    - The [Search API](#20219386-4c34-485e-a859-c697d64f2ae9) accepts various
    input criteria which are used to return Contacts, Companies, Scoops, News
    and Intent records. The purpose of Search is to cast a wide net, returning a
    list of records that meet the input criteria. The records returned are
    previews of the full ZoomInfo profile. Use the Enrich API endpoints to
    return ZoomInfo's full profile for any record.
        
    - The [Enrich API](#4c495fb6-68df-44bb-8703-0616f81cfdcb) is used to
    retrieve ZoomInfo's full profile data by matching to known contacts or
    companies. Use the Enrich endpoints to redeem full profiles returned from
    Search queries, or enrich your existing database of contacts and companies
    with ZoomInfo data.
        
    - The [Lookup API](#efe7b4b8-1ef2-4fcd-a20f-9da68f6b2055) includes a set of
    endpoints that return available inputs and outputs for corresponding Search
    or Enrich requests. Use the Input Lookup endpoints to help select the input
    criteria supported by the different requests. The Lookup Output endpoints
    provide a full list of fields returned by each endpoint.
        
    - The [Usage API](#ec3704c0-8898-4ba7-baf4-c45b46ef80d3) lets you check your
    current API usage and limits.
        

    **Scaling APIs**


    - The [Webhooks API](#0a3012d3-546c-45bd-9a3c-d014b93ce47e) is a set of
    endpoints that lets you configure webhooks subscriptions to automate the
    update of records - listening for events you subscribe to, and sending
    updates securely to your application.
        
    - The [Bulk API](#00c2d0c8-d0f6-4904-a5b1-495675e13189) is a set of
    endpoints that provide bulk search and redeem capabilities for Contacts and
    Companies, enabling the search and retrieval of large ZoomInfo Company and
    Contact datasets at scale through asynchronous batch processes.
        

    **WebSights API**


    The [WebSights API](#9e5ec7b8-5cef-40ee-86f3-105be2194fe7) identifies
    anonymous website traffic by resolving IP addresses to return company and
    ISP profiles and IP Geolocation details.


    **Compliance API**


    The [Compliance API](#8631bd5c-4435-4fb4-9d4f-91b73cf7e89e) includes
    endpoints related to data privacy and opt-out compliance for contacts stored
    in the ZoomInfo database.


    # Authentication methods


    The API supports the following authentication methods:


    - Private Key Infrastructure (PKI)
        
    - Username and password
        

    For both authentication methods, a Java Web Token (JWT) is returned which
    can be programmatically or manually used to access the API.


    ## Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication


    The preferred authentication method is to obtain a Client ID and Private key
    pair and a public library to programmatically generate a JWT that is valid
    for one hour. To do this:


    1. Log in to the ZoomInfo GUI using admin credentials with API access.
        
    2. Go to **Admin Portal** > **API** and click **Generate New Key**. You are
    provided with a Client ID and a Private Key.
        
    3. Import a public library that authenticates using this Client ID and
    Private Key and generates a JWT.
        

    ZoomInfo provides supported PKI authentication libraries for Java, Python
    and NodeJS in [Github](https://github.com/Zoominfo).


    ## Username and password authentication


    You can use the [Authentication
    endpoint](#ea1ebd5d-8b4a-412f-a8c8-3d8b8e123407) to manually supply your
    username and password, returning a JWT that is valid for one hour.


    A developer can alternatively import a public library that authenticates a
    username and password to return a JWT. ZoomInfo provides supported username
    and password authentication libraries for Java, Python and NodeJS in
    [Github](https://github.com/Zoominfo).


    # Rate and usage limits


    The ZoomInfo API uses rate and usage limits tied to the account provisioned
    for API access. Your API account is provisioned with:


    - **Rate limits**: A limit to the number of requests you can make within a
    given time period.
        
        - For the Authentication endpoint, the limit is 1 request per second.
            
        - For the Standard APIs, WebSights API, and Compliance API, the limit is 25 requests per second (1500 request per minute).
            
        - For the Scaling APIs, the limit is 33 requests per second (2000 requests per minute)
            
    - **Request limits**: An overall number of requests you can perform within
    the current API contract term.
        
    - **Record limits**: The number of records you are entitled to retrieve
    within the current API contract term.
        

    You can track usage status using the [Usage Lookup
    endpoint](#ec3704c0-8898-4ba7-baf4-c45b46ef80d3).


    You can also track usage using the response headers of each API call (with
    the exception of the Authentication and Lookup endpoints).

                                A programming language is the language with
                                which you write programs. It can be Python, C,
                                Java, etc. A framework is a collection of
                                programs that do something useful and which you
                                can use to develop your own applications. A
                                framework guides you on how to do something
                                (like a predefined way of doing things).

                                Developers use Docker to eliminate “works on my
                                machine” problems when collaborating on code
                                with co-workers. Operators use Docker to run and
                                manage apps side-by-side in isolated containers
                                to get better compute density. Enterprises use
                                Docker to build agile software delivery
                                pipelines.

                                express your application's components clearly
                                and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and

                      Docker is a software container platform. Developers use
                      Docker to eliminate “works on my machine” problems when
                      collaborating on code with co-workers. Operators use
                      Docker to run and manage apps side-by-side in isolated
                      containers to get better compute density. Enterprises use
                      Docker to build agile software delivery pipelines.

                      antivirus, intrusion prevention, and virtual private
                      network (VPN) capabilities. It provides proactive threat
                      defense that stops attacks before they spread through the
                      network. Cisco ASA can be used as a security solution for
                      both small and large networks.
