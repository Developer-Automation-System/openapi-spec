        FedEx creates and delivers a return shipping label to your customer and
        collects the item for return. Your customer needs to have the package
        ready for pickup when the FedEx driver arrives. Use this endpoint to
        create tag requests for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments.

      summary: Validate Shipment
      description: >-
        Use this endpoint to verify the accuracy of a shipment request prior to
        actually submitting shipment request. This allow businesses that receive
        shipping orders from end-user/customers to verify the shipment
        information prior to submitting a create shipment request to FedEx and
        printing a label. If for any reason the information needs to be edited
        or changed, it can be done while the end-user is still available to
        confirm the changes.<br><br>Note:<ul><li>This is shipment level
        validation hence supports validation for single piece shipment
        only.</li><li>Shipment validation is supported for all Express and
        Ground - Domestic as well as international shipments with all applicable
        special services. </li><li>Shipment validation is supported for
        SmartPost and not for Freight LTL shipments.</li></ul>
